# .gitignore file
# The .gitignore file defines which files and directories should be ignored by Git in the project.
# It must be tracked in version control to ensure that all team members follow the same rules for

# ignore rules, leading to inconsistencies in which files are tracked or ignored.
# By committing the .gitignore file, we ensure that the entire team maintains the same
