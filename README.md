# About
DurabilityNotifier is a plugin which will help your players save their items. It will notify them when their items (armor, weapons, tools) fall below the value specified in the config.

# Notify types
You can send message in chat or action bar and play the sound to player.

# Everything is configurable
1. You can edit every message which you or your players will se
2. You can disable every notification type
3. You can specify after which value notification would be trigerred
4. Also you can send notification when item is broken

# Tips
1. I would recommend you to set "required-durability" as low as possible, because otherwise, the player may receive spam messages when, for example, he digs something.
2. It would be better if you chose only 1 type of message notification + sound, if you want.
